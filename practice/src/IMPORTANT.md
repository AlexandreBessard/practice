Input Array Sorted:
-> Binary Search
-> Two Pointers

All permutations/subsets:
-> Backtracking

Given a Tree:
-> DFS
-> BFS

Given a Graph:
-> BFS
-> DFS

Given LinkedList:
-> Two pointers

Recursion banned then:
-> Stack

Must Solve in-place then:
-> Swap corresponding value
-> Store on or more different values in the same pointer

Asked for Max/Min subarray/subset
-> Dynamic Programming

Asked for Top/Least K items:
-> Heap

Asked common Strings:
-> Map
-> Trie

Else
-> Map/Set O(1) time & O(n) space
-> Sort input fo O(nlogn) time and O(1) space
