// Java program to Illustrate Concept of Composition

/*
Real-life Example: Library system

Letâ€™s understand the composition in Java with the example of books and library.
In this example, we create a class Book that contains data members like author,
and title and create another class Library that has a reference to refer to the list of books.
A library can have no. of books on the same or different subjects.
So, If the Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed. i.e.,
books can not exist without a library. The relationship between the library and books is composition.
