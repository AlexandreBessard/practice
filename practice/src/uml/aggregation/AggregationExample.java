// Concept of Aggregation

/*
It is a special form of Association where:

It represents Has-Aâ€™s relationship.
It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship.
For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not
possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
In Aggregation, both entries can survive individually which means
 ending one entity will not affect the other entity.
