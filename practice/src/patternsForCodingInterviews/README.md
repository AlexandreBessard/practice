Sliding Window:
Given an array, find the average of each subarray of 'K' contiguous elements in it.

Two pointers:
Given an array of sorted numbers and a target sum, find a pair in the array whose sum is equal to the 
given target.

Merge Intervals:
Overlapping intervals.

Cyclic sort:
Given unsorted array containing n numbers from 1 to n. Array can have duplicates which means some numbers will
be missing. Find all the missing numbers.

BFS:
Technique to traverse a tree (by level).

DFS:
Traverse tree using recursion.

Two Heaps:
Set of elements such that we can divide them into two parts.
Smallest element in one part and biggest element in the other part.

Binary Search:
Sorted array, find a certain element.

Top K elements:
Find the top/smallest frequent 'K' element among a given set falls under this pattern.

K-way merge:
List of sorted array

Topological sort:
Find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other.
If 'B' is dependent on event 'A', 'A' comes before 'B' in topological ordering.
