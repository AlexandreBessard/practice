Heap: is like a Binarytree

Problem that asks to find the top/smaller/frequent 'k' elements use this pattern.

MaxHeap: Every parent is greater than or equal to its children
MinHeap: Every parent is less than or equal to its children

MaxHeap: the root is always the greater value
MinHeap: the root is always the smaller value
