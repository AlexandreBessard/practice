A topological ordering is possible only when the graph has no directed cycles, i.e. if the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
 If the graph has a cycle, some vertices will have cyclic dependencies which makes it impossible to find a linear ordering among vertices.
Steps to implement the algorithm:
a: Initialization.
b: Build the graph
c: Find all sources
d: Sort
