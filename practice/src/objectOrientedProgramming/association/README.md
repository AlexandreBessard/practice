Association in Java defines the connection between two classes that are set up through their objects. 
Association manages one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships

It shows how objects communicate 
with each other and how they use the functionality and services provided by that communicated object.


Let's take an example of each relationship to manage by the Association.

1) A person can have only one passport. It defines the one-to-one

2) If we talk about the Association between a College and Student, a College can have many students. 
It defines the one-to-many

3) A state can have several cities, and those cities are related to that single state. 
It defines the many-to-one

4) A single student can associate with multiple teachers, and multiple students can also be associated 
with a single teacher. Both are created or deleted independently, so 
it defines the many-to-many
