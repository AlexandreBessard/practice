Bidirectional Association: 
When objects involved in association communicate with each other, it is called bidirectional association.

A very common example of bidirectional relationship is “Person and Address”. 
We can have bidirectional many-to-many relationship between person and address objects.

In other words, a person can have associated with multiple addresses and an address can belong to multiple people. 
This shows the many-to-many relationship.
