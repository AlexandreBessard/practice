The fundamentals of object-oriented software are as follows:

1) Encapsulation 
This concept asserts that an object contains all essential information and 
only a subset of it is accessible.

2) Abstraction
Objects only show fundamentals processes.
Capabilities of a class can be expanded.

3) Inheritance
Classes can reuse software from other categories, and developers may develop 
partnerships and subclasses among items, allowing them to reuse similar logic.

4) Polymorphism
The software will figure out which interpretation or usage is required for 
each operation of an instance from a class diagram, avoiding the requirement for code 
duplication. 
After that, a child category is generated, expanding the parental classâ€™s capabilities.
