Kadane's Algorithm is an algorithm that can find the maximum sum subarray given an array of numbers in O(n) time and O(1) space


Kind of problem using Kadane algorithm:
Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) 
with the largest sum 
or in other words the maximum sum contiguous subarray and print its sum.
