Kadane's Algorithm is an algorithm that can find the maximum sum subarray given an array of numbers in O(n) time and O(1) space


Kind of problem using Kadane algorithm:
Given an integer array, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) 
with the largest sum 
or in other words the maximum sum contiguous subarray and print its sum.

(subarray is a slice of a contiguous array that maintains order of the elements
sub-array may comprise a single element from the given array OR the given array as a whole too)
