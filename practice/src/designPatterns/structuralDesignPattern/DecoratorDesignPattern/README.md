Decorator design pattern allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object 
without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class.

Do not alter its structure. (no change to the original class), method's signature unchanged.
Single responsibility principle since we divide the functionality into classes with unique areas of concern.
