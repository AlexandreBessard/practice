Singleton Design Pattern:
It follows “define a class that has
only one instance and provides a global point of access to it“.
The class must ensure that only a single instance should be
created and a single object can be used by all other classes.

Advantages:

It is designed to save memory.
The object is not created on every request, instead, a single instance is reused.
