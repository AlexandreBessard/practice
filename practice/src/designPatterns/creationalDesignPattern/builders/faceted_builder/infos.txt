The Faceted Builder Pattern is a sub pattern of the builder pattern.
Its purpose is to clarify the construction of a complex object “fluently.”
Let’s say we want to build a Person object with its personal & professional data (personal info, work adress...).
This pattern enables us to have this:

PersonBuilder pb = new PersonBuilder();
        Person person = pb
                .lives()   // Return PersonAddressBuilder
                    .at("123 London Road")
                    .in("London")
                    .withPostcode("SW12BC")
                .works()    //Return PersonJobBuilder
                    .at("Fabrikam")
                    .asA("Engineer")
                    .earning(123000)
                .build();
        System.out.println(person);

The idea is to define a PersonBuilder class that will have 2 subclasses:
PersonAddressBuilder & PersonJobBuilder
