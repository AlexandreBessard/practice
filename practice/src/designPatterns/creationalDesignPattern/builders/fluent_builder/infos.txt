Fluent builder pattern is a style of coding which force the developer to create the object in
sequence by calling each setter method one after the another until all required attributes are set.

If your requirement is to build a complex object for which you want to set the mandatory attributes and avoid making any mistakes,
then the fluent builder will be more useful rather than the traditional builder pattern.
