Construct object piece by piece (like StringBuilder)

We can solve the issues with large number of parameters by providing a constructor with required parameters and then
different setter methods to set the optional parameters. The problem with this approach is that the Object state will
be inconsistent until unless all the attributes are set explicitly. Builder pattern solves the issue with large number
of optional parameters and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step and provide a method
that will actually return the final Object.

When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.
