Factory Design Pattern: It follows the principle of “Define an interface or
abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide
which class to instantiate“.

Factory: A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.

Advantages:
It is designed to allow all the sub-classes
to choose the type of objects so as to create them.

Create an object where object creation logic is hidden from the client.
