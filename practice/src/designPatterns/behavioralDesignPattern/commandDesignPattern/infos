Command Design Pattern: It encapsulates a request under an object
 as a command and passes it to the invoker object.
 Invoker object looks for the appropriate object
 which can handle this command and pass the command to the
 corresponding object and that object executes the command.
 It is also known as Action or Transaction.

Advantages:

It separates the object that invokes the operation with
the object that actually performs the operation.
